# DevelBoard
Software Architecture Project. HackerRank-style application where users can undertake coding challenges and see how they compare with the rest of the world.

## System Architecture
The application is structured in layers, it is divided in frontend (angular), backend (nodejs/express) and database (neo4j). The frontend only communicates with the backend using the HTTP protocol, the backend communicates with the frontend and the database, and the database only communicates with the backend. The backend has a distributed service based structure. It has a proxy layer that receives HTTP requests from the frontend (through express) and forwards them to the correct service for processing (through kafka). So once it receives a request in a certain endpoint, the proxy layer will send a kafka message on the respective topic, then each consumer will read that message from the topic and process it, saving the results in the database (if necessary) and producing a response that gets sent back to the proxy as a message through kafka (if necessary). If a certain request has to wait for a response the proxy will create a kafka consumer and once the response gets sent back (from the consumer in the service) it will forward it as an HTTP response. The backend has a number of different services each of which has a number of different kafka consumers (consumers are logically divided into each service). Each service may be duplicated if the application has to scale up, and each service may be further divided by separating each kafka consumer into its own service. The services are all independent of each other and only comunicare with the proxy through kafka and with the database. The proxy only comunicates with the frontend (using the HTTP protocol) and with the different services (using kafka). The application will be built and deployed using docker and the different components (frontend, proxy, services, kafka, database) will all run in separate containers, which will communicate as described earlier. Load balancing of the backend is done automatically through kafka, so each topic which is assigned to a different consumer group may be partitioned. When the proxy sends a message to a topic, the message will be sent to a specific partition of that topic according to some logic (by default a round robin logic is used) and then kafka automatically assign each partition to only one consumer in the consumer group that is assigned to that topic. So if the number of consumers is the same as the number of partitions there will be a one to one correspondence between partitions and consumers. Also reassignments of partitions and deletion of read messages are all automatically managed by kafka. The database is shared between all services because it's a graph database so it relies heavily on the relationships between the nodes, and therefore it would have been complicated to divide. The application is stateless and it uses JSON Web Tokens to manage sessions. This means that for every request (that requires it) the backend checks that a valid JWT is sent together with the request. The JWT sent with the request identifies the user that sends the request and was generated by the backend when the user first logged in (and then it got shared with the user). This way the backend doesn't need to keep track of the sessions but it knows everytime who is making the request. If the user doesn't have a valid token (that gets stored in the localstorage of the user's browser by the frontend) he has to log in again in order to generate a new one.

## Limitations
This version of the application is still in beta so some features are limited and/or missing, below is a full list of the limitations and missing functionalities:

- Edit Profile has not been implemented yet
- Everyone can create a new challenge, whilst in the final version only admins can create new challenges
- When creating a challenge the test cases and the result cases must be formatted following the example given as a place holder in their respective fields
- Users can only undertake challenges once
- The leaderboard is a generic leaderboard that displays the percentage of correct answers of every user in the system, in the final version more than one leaderboard will be available and the leaderboards will be more specific
- The only supported language for the challenges is java, whereas in the final version more languages will be supported
- In the java code a user submits for a challenge he must provide the main method (defined as public static void main(String[] args))
- The main method has to print the final result using System.out.println()
- Everything the program outputs to standard output will be compared against the test cases
- Test cases are passed as args to the main method
- All other classes must be declared as static

In the final version most of these limitations will no longer be present.

## Example
For example if our challenge is to write a program that adds two numbers, then our program would be:
```
public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println(Integer.valueOf(args[0]) + Integer.valueOf(args[1]));
}
```

## Build and Deploy
This version of the application can only be run through docker, below are the commands that have to be used to build and run the application. Both commands have to be run in the main folder (where the docker-compose file is located).
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Then the application will be available at localhost:4200
